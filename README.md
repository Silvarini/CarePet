## About
<p><font size="3">
This application aims to address that problem by creating a more attractive and fun interaction with the user in which the central element of the application is a virtual pet, which draws attention to medication and task management. 
  
The pet will interact when the user is petting him and depending on a communication protocol developed for it, talk to the user in different times of the day with relevant interventions and task notification. The more the user interacts with the virtual pet, the higher the level of affection and the dialogues change.</p>
